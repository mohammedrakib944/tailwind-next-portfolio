            My Name is Md.Rakibuzzaman (Rakib). I am an undergraduate computer
            science student. I have been doing programming since 2016. In early
            stage I learned HTML, CSS, and javascript. Javscript ! is my
            favorite Language ðŸ¥°. I started to do competitive programming in
            2019 then learn Data Structure and Algorithms. And Solved many
            problems on different websites like codechef.com, codeforces.com,
            hackerrank.com, etc. Besides, I attend Programming contests.

          <p className="py-2 text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-lg">
            Then I move to full stack development and Learn React js, Next js,
            Tailwind, Node js, Express js, and MongoDB. My goal was to be a
            skilled full stack developer. On the middle of 2021, I got a job. I
            did the job for 8 months as Front End Developer. Now a days, I am
            doing freelancing projects for my clients, And of course, Learning
            new technologies.
